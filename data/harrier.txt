	description "The Harrier is a ship that can fulfil most of a captain's needs. As well as acting as a freighter, the Harrier can be used as a mining ship. It can also boast 4 powerful Particle Cannons, making it a sort of glorified Quicksilver. However, despite its size, the Harrier lacks any turrets. In order to counteract this it has been fitted with generous amounts of engine space."
